# 📐 **Computor v1** – Solving Polynomials Like a Pro (or trying to)

Welcome to **Computor v1**, where I get to show off my mad polynomial-solving skills, using Rust 🦀.
<br/>
🧮 This project is all about tackling 2nd-degree (or lower) polynomial equations. If you've ever felt the need to flex your math muscles—or if you just want to stop copying formulas from the internet—this is your chance!

## 🚀 **Features**
- Reduces polynomial equations like a boss. 🔥
- Identifies the degree of the polynomial. (Because, well, that's important.)
- Solves for real and complex solutions. No guesswork here, just pure math magic. 🧙‍♂️
- Tells you how spicy your discriminant is (positive, negative, or zero—it’s like a mood ring for your equations).

### Example:

```bash
$ ./computor "5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0"
Reduced form: 4 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 0
Polynomial degree: 2
Discriminant is strictly positive, the two solutions are:
0.905239 and -0.475131
```

## 💡 **Bonus Features**
- Handles your messed-up input. Yes, I know you like freeform. 🙃
- Reduces solutions to neat, irreducible fractions. So elegant. ✨
- Shows intermediate steps—because math is a journey, not a destination.

## How to Use
Clone this bad boy, compile it (Rust does the heavy lifting), and then unleash your inner mathematician.
